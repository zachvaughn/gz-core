# GZ (libGDX personal project)

GZ as of now, is a simple 2D top down rogue-like shooter that features AI enemies, and a pre-made tile map.

# Instructions on how to run the game
To run the game, clone into IntelliJ and then scroll down to
"lwjgl3\src\main\java\io.github.groundzero\Lwjgl3Launcher"
and click the run button in the top right as you would to run any other program.

# Instructions on how to play the game
Launch the game, click play and then it takes you into the game screen where you spawn with an AR, 120 bullets,
and can walk around using (W, A, S, D) and left-click on mouse to shoot, when your mag is empty, the gun will automatically reload,
or if you would like to reload when needed, just press "R"

Spawns basic AI enemies as well. When an enemy dies, they also have a chance of dropping a medkit which will heal you to full health.
When the player dies, it displays the dead texture and sends you back to the main menu screen where you can play again or exit.

## Platforms

- `core`: Main module with the application logic shared by all platforms.
- `lwjgl3`: Primary desktop platform using LWJGL3; was called 'desktop' in older docs.

## Gradle

This project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to manage dependencies.
The Gradle wrapper was included, so you can run Gradle tasks using `gradlew.bat` or `./gradlew` commands.
Useful Gradle tasks and flags:

- `--continue`: when using this flag, errors will not stop the tasks from running.
- `--daemon`: thanks to this flag, Gradle daemon will be used to run chosen tasks.
- `--offline`: when using this flag, cached dependency archives will be used.
- `--refresh-dependencies`: this flag forces validation of all dependencies. Useful for snapshot versions.
- `build`: builds sources and archives of every project.
- `cleanEclipse`: removes Eclipse project data.
- `cleanIdea`: removes IntelliJ project data.
- `clean`: removes `build` folders, which store compiled classes and built archives.
- `eclipse`: generates Eclipse project data.
- `idea`: generates IntelliJ project data.
- `lwjgl3:jar`: builds application's runnable jar, which can be found at `lwjgl3/build/libs`.
- `lwjgl3:run`: starts the application.
- `test`: runs unit tests (if any).

Note that most tasks that are not specific to a single project can be run with `name:` prefix, where the `name` should be replaced with the ID of a specific project.
For example, `core:clean` removes `build` folder only from the `core` project.
