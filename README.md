# gz-core
gz-core is a personal portfolio project built in Java using the libGDX framework. It is a small 2D top-down shooter developed to explore game architecture, real-time input handling, enemy AI behavior, and state-driven gameplay systems.  

This project is not intended to be a production-ready game or reusable library. It was created to demonstrate design decisions, implementation skills, and familiarity with game development concepts in Java.

## Gameplay Overview
- 2D top-down perspective
- W/A/S/D movement
- Shooting via left mouse button
- Hostile AI-controlled enemies
- Enemy drops (medkits, ammo packs)
- Health and ammo restoration via pickups
- Game resets to the main menu on player death

On Windows:
```bash
gradlew lwjgl3:run
```

## Background
This project was originally developed as an academic project and
later refined, cleaned up, and published as a personal project.

- Experimentation with game systems and mechanics
- Iterative development rather than feature completeness
- A focus on code structure and learning outcomes
